** This is where all of the notes and annotations can go for our project **

1. Make the sidebar padding smaller when in mobile view
2. Make the logo a bit smaller so the feet do not break the nav bar.
3. Add the animation we had so it looks like the logo is lifting out the window.
4. Fill in the default filler text for the Skills Page
